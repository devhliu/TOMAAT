Welcome to TOMAAT's documentation!
==================================

TOMAAT allows you to make deep learning models public by providing them
with an interface to communicate with the "outside" world.
This interface is built on top of HTTP 1.1 through a framework called Klein.

Here you can find documentation about TOMAAT that will help you get started with it.
